"# TicTacToe"

command to compile and link: 
    g++ core_functions.cpp execution_functions.cpp modes.cpp main.cpp -o program 

to run:
    install a compiler with all the libraries (I used stdio.h, string.h and stdib.h and MinGW w64 compiler)
    set up path variable (MinGW\bin)
    download files (all the .cpp files and include folder (with .h files))
    
    or just download the executable (program.exe)
